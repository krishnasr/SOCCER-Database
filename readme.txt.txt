1. spoolfile1.txt contains output of DESC TABLE_NAME; and SHOW TABLES;
2. after executing the python program, spoolfile2.txt contains output of SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME; 
3. database_program_insertvalues1.py is for questions 4,5,6 for violating integrity constraint so I have not added ON DELETE ON UPDATE for that code.
4. database_program_insertvalues.py is used for all other questions.
5. item 3.txt has the query codes for question 3.
6. spoolfile4,5,6 has the errors and explanation for the errors are also included in the spoolfile.
